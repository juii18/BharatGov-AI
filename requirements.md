# BharatGov AI – Intelligent Government Scheme Discovery Platform

## Overview

In India, many government schemes are launched every year for farmers, students, women, and small business owners. However, a large number of eligible citizens are not able to benefit from these schemes because they are unaware of them or find the information difficult to understand.

Most scheme details are available on different websites, written in complex language, and not easily accessible to rural and regional users.

## Objective

The goal of BharatGov AI is to develop an intelligent assistant that helps users identify government schemes they are eligible for by simply entering their details or asking questions in natural language.

The system will simplify access to important welfare programs using Artificial Intelligence.

## Target Users

- Farmers
- Students
- Job seekers
- Women
- Small business owners
- Rural and semi-urban population

## Key Functionalities

- Accept user input in text or voice form
- Analyze user profile information such as occupation, state, and category
- Identify and recommend relevant government schemes
- Provide clear explanation about scheme benefits and eligibility
- Support regional language interaction (future enhancement)

## Technology Components

- Python for backend processing
- Streamlit for user interface
- Large Language Models for intelligent responses
- Vector database for storing scheme information
- Cloud platform (AWS) for deployment

## Expected Result

The system will assist users in discovering government schemes quickly and easily, reducing the gap between citizens and available welfare programs.
